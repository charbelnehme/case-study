## Business Activities ##

**What specific financial activities is the company or project trying to solve? 

Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 

What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? 

**SMART Box™** is the new way to compare business loans. It stands for: Straightforward Metrics Around Rate and Total cost and shows key metrics so you can compare the cost of capital. Because when it comes to business loans, it pays to compare.

Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? **

Moula uses data, AI and machine learning to assess business loan applications made online. Successful applications can result in business loans of up to $500,000 being made available in 24-48 hours. 
Justin Green is the Chief Product and Strategy Officer for Moula explains why traditional banks don’t work for many Australian businesses –

> “If you don’t have the benefit of assets, like the family home to put up as collateral, then your ability to borrow money from the bank is pretty limited. So Moula’s thesis was very much ‘can we partner with small businesses?’, try and demystify this volatility that exists in small businesses, encourage this open-sharing of business data, as the critical asset to understand the nature of someone’s business.” – Justin Green

Green says the actual process of applying for a Moula business loan takes 7-10 minutes. It involves completing a fairly light touch application form, and granting approval for Moula to access the applicant’s business data. That’s generally achieved through an API into a data source, such as Xero.

According to Paul Pesavento, Moula’s Chief Data Officer; 

> “Taking into consideration the licensing and service expenses, Azure is more cost-effective. As we are using PaaS, we are no longer concerned with updating the VMs and patching the frameworks. Azure provides better and more fine-grained security. It has helped us to use advanced threat detection and security features in Azure SQL databases we are using. Last but not least, we can scale up to any kind of workload we have to deal with.”

Moula worked with Microsoft partner, BizData to plan and execute the transition. Together they established an Azure based data warehouse using Azure SQL DB, implemented Power BI to run business analytics, and leverage Azure AI and machine learning capabilities to assess data and analyse risk.
Rachel Bondi, general manager, One Commercial Partner, Microsoft Australia, applauds the partnership between BizData and Moula, for the vision it brought to the market.

> “Small business is the engine room of Australia’s economy. It’s where most people work, and without small business big business simply could not function. The vision of Moula in terms of liberating the value in small business data is impressive, and the partnership with BizData using Microsoft AI technology to bring that vision to life is a prime example of collaboration across our ecosystem to bring about not just business transformation, but sector transformation.”
AI and machine learning key to success

A machine learning decision model developed using Scikit-Learn machine learning algorithms that are accessed through Azure Machine Learning Services, then provide a prediction of the probability (or risk) of the SME being able to pay back its loan.

Moula has been able to refine that prediction by using historical data from past applicants to train the model. “The machine learning models also provide useful context in the form of the relative importance of each of the pieces of information that it has based its decision on,” says Pesavento.

> “We use Azure Machine Learning Services to calibrate the risk engine models, which includes retraining them on updated historical data and assessing the performance of alternate models and associated hyperparameters.”

With a DevOps approach to innovation Pesavento explains; “We are using App Services for .net, app service containers for Linux, Functions, Azure SQL database, ServiceBus, CosmosDB, Azure Documents, Data Factory, Key Vault, VMs.”

The technology foundations now in place at Moula are also supporting its ongoing innovation efforts. Green points to the initiative with Xero which offers a buy-now pay-later facility for small businesses.

> “Essentially this uses some payment service integration for Xero accounting customers as merchants. So they can issue invoices and get paid upfront, while their end-customer is able to repay over 12 months with Moula Pay, and benefits from the three months, no interest, no repayments opportunity.”

Well aware of the value of that data Moula deploys multiple layers of defence in order to ensure data is protected. As part of its security controls, Moula takes advantage of Azure security features such as Advanced Data Security and Dynamic Data Masking.

It also has documents and files stored in private storage accounts accessible via its own application and uses KeyVault to ensure there are no naked connection strings or access keys in any deployed applications. It also employs IP whitelisting and subnets to restrict access to some applications and VMs. Operating in a currently self-regulated part of the financial services market Moula nevertheless expects to be impacted by changing regulations affecting other institutions.

Pesavento for example expects that the arrival of open banking in Australia will accelerate the interest in alternative financial solutions as people and business grow used to greater choice and flexibility.

> “Whilst customers already have the ability to share their banking data with us, the move to open banking should make this practice more common place and trusted, and help customers feel more in control of their data and able to use that data to more easily and more quickly access services from non-bank providers including Moula. “More of our potential customers will feel more confident and in control of their banking data, and being more aware of it as a way of doing business. It just increases the appetite for the sort of services we provide and for customers to look outside of their existing banking relationships.”


**What domain of the financial industry is the company in? 

### What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years? ###

In 2019, the A$3.8 billion Australian fintech sector1 saw 252 per cent growth in fintech investment.  Frost and Sullivan estimated growth between 2015-20 to be 76.3 per cent per annum and with more than 40 per cent of consumers yet to become fintech adopters the market is predicted to grow further to $18 billion by 20301.

Australian FinTech revenue will grow at a CAGR of 76.3% and exceed A$4 billion by 2020, driven by reduced taxes on investments in startups, steady increase in mobile payments, and rise of Tech-savy digital natives. The Australian Fintech Sector generated A$247.2 million in 2015. Sharp growth in the Fintech market in 2016 and 2017, followed by steady increases through to 2020, is likely spur growth.

Frost and Sullivan defines the Australian FinTech sector as comprising three market segments: digital payments, personal and business finance, financial infrastructure and data analysis. Each segment’s unique method of disrupting the financial services sector relies on its own digital technologies. This report focuses on the way these segments will grow by 2020 and the challenges that FinTech companies will face.

Australian FinTech is in the development stage of the business cycle, and the FinTech start-up space has grown rapidly and is set to drive $10 billion of revenue away from existing financial institutions and ensure $3 billion worth of added revenue.

Innovation hubs provide a strong foundation for start-ups to operate and reach positive cash flow. A$438 million of investment in Australian FinTech in 2015 was concentrated in Sydney.

Some disruptors have been observed in the growing Australian FinTech market. New EFTPOS and online charging solutions will allow more merchants to be paid through credit cards but also drive down the cost of receiving payments. The replacement of financial advice teams with Robo-Advice teams will be hugely attractive to established financial institutions that want to cut labour costs. Blockchain will radically reduce costs by decentralising ledgers for financial settlements.

Market revenue in this report only includes revenues of those companies that disrupt the existing financial sector. FinTech companies included in this report use technologies that fundamentally challenge existing financial institutions.

The base year for analysis is 2015 and the forecast period is 2016 to 2020. Revenue is provided given in US dollars when pertaining to the global FinTech sector and in Australian Dollars when pertaining to the Australian FinTech sector.
